#Ansible Project

This project is a simple example of how to use Ansible to automate the deployment of a web application, in this case a simple wordpress site.
That project is part of the Ansible module in the Upskill formation for SysAdmins.
It is asked by the formator to use ansible to configure 3 servers, one for the database, one for the web server and one windows server.

We use terraform to create the infrastructure on azure and ansible to deploy the application.
